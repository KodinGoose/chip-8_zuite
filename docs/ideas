This file contains ideas for new features which haven't been implemented yet

Assembly:
	Being able to pass aliases with '*' instead of ':'
		'*' would pass the an aliases address as a number and ':' would pass what is at the aliases address
		Example:
			set 8 :func_1_arg_1 *func_2
			call :func_1
			Here func_1 would call the address written to func_1_arg_1
