This file contains ideas for new features which haven't been implemented yet

Assembly:
	Being able to pass aliases with '*' instead of ':'
		'*' would pass the an aliases address as a number and ':' would pass the aliases address normally
		Example:
			set 8 :func_1_arg_1 *func_2 (Here set would be assembled to 0x30 instead of 0x31)
			call :func_1
			Here func_1 would call the address written to func_1_arg_1
		Manually giving an address would happen with ':' instead of '*'
		Example: "call *0x50" would instead be "call :0x50"
		Manually giving an address with '*' would not be allowed since '*0x50' and '0x50' would literally be the same thing
